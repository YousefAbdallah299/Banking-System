# Banking-System
The banking application enables bank clients to create and manage bank accounts. There are two types of accounts: basic BankAccount and SavingsBankAccount. The basic BankAccount includes account ID and balance, with methods for withdrawal and deposit. The SavingsBankAccount extends the basic account and adds a minimum balance requirement and minimum deposit amount. The Client class stores client information and holds a reference to their bank account. The main BankingApplication class presents a menu for performing operations on bank accounts, maintaining lists of accounts and clients.
